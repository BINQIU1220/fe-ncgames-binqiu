## About

Welcome! This is a frontend project which was build with React framework and Axios for the back end API queries. It combined the backend api I build before, which you can find for info here in my repo _BE-NC-Game-Workplace_.

Users can filter games by category and sort/order them or combined these 2 droplists together for more precise result. The share icon works as to copy the current URL to the clipboard.

For devand test purposes, a hardcoded superuser is provided to allow vote and add/delete comment on all reviews.

PS: UI is still very rudimemntary as I am going to learn CSS skill. Have fun!
