## About

Welcome! This is a frontend project which was build with React framework and Axios for the back end API queries. It combined the my backend service, which you can find info here in my repo `be_nc_games_workplace`.

Visitors can filter games by category and sort/order them or combined these 2 droplists together for more precise result. The share icon works as to copy the current URL to the clipboard.

For dev and test purposes, a hardcoded superuser is provided by default to allow visitors to vote and add/delete comment on all reviews.
