## About

Welcome! This is a frontend project which utilises the backend api I build before, which you can find in my repo _BE-NC-Game-Workplace_. 

Users can filter reviews by category and sort/order them or combined these 2 droplists together for more precise result. The share icon works as to copy the current URL to the clipboard.

For dev purposes, a hardcoded user is provided to allow vote and comment on each review. User _Banana_ on the top right side is just for fun :)

PS: UI is still very rudimemntary as I am going to learn CSS skill. Have fun!
